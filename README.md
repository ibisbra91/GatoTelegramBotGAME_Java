# GatoTelegramBotGAME_Java
GatoBotGAME_java is a Telegram chatbot game. I used Java, IDEIntelliJ IDEA, Git, MAVEN, etc. I developed it during the 5 days of the Java Marathon guided by CodeGym. A busy challenge that I joined from Sunday, April 21, 2024 to Thursday, April 25. I appreciate the opportunity to practice my Java skills and knowledge. I was satisfied.
